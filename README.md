---

Press **[M]** at any time to bring up the world map.

The map is an abstracted view of the world, with tiles representing biomes and structures.

It can be zoomed in as far as 4 chunks across, and out as far as 400.

Markers can be named and added to the map any time, available in selection of icons.

### Design

We didn't make this mod! But we have strong opinions about it - primarily, that an abstracted view of the world prevents the map from getting in the way of experiencing the world as-is. 

Antique Atlas is perfect to stop you from getting lost, but it never gets in the way of looking at the world.<br/>

When forking the mod, we wanted to make sure players could never get lost - so the map is always available. 

Our intent is that the atlas is a metaphysical representation of the player's own _lay of the land_ - a memory of everywhere you've explored so far. We'd still like to keep small touches like the player appearing to physically look at a book in multiplayer, and being able to share map knowledge, but the item stays gone.

### Compatibility

Versions `8.x` and `9.x` (listed as 0.8 and 0.9 on modrinth) have a similar architecture to Antique Atlas for 1.16-1.18.<br/>Versions following `1.0.0` have major breakages, and use the mod ID `antique-atlas` to prevent conflicts.

### Afterword

All mods are built on the work of many others.

This mod specifically is a fourth-gen offshoot, and relies heavily on the excellent tile art by Hunternif as well as the code contributions of many developers before us.<br/>[We can't draw autotile to save our lives](https://github.com/AntiqueAtlasTeam/AntiqueAtlas/wiki/Editing-Textures) - feel free to contribute!

If you usually rely on a minimap for a sense of cardinal direction, try [PicoHUD](https://modrinth.com/mod/picohud)!

This mod is included in [Tinkerer's Quilt Plus](https://modrinth.com/modpack/tinkerers-quilt) - our modpack about rediscovering vanilla.

We're open to suggestions for how to implement stuff better - if you see something wonky and have an idea - let us know.
